The Portal Project Teaching Database is a simplified version of the Portal
Project Database designed for teaching. It provides a real world example of
life-history, population, and ecological data, with sufficient complexity to
teach many aspects of data analysis and management, but with many complexities
removed to allow students to focus on the core ideas and skills being taught.

The database is currently available in csv, json, and sqlite.

Use of this dataset should cite: http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1314459

If you want to use the Portal Project database for research we recommend obtaining
the data from [the main database](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData) or by
using the [portalr R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web//packages/portalr/index.html)
(which provides easy access to and processing of the main database). The main
database includes more kinds of data, continues to the present instead of
stopping in 2002, and includes additional QA/QC.
